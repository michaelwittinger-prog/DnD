  "narration": "Seren dashes across the cobblestones, closing the gap to Captain Voss in a single stride. She brings her blade around in a swift arc. The edge bites through his guard and draws blood.",
  "adjudication": "Movement: Seren moves from (5,6) to (6,6), 1 square (5 ft). Her speed allows up to 30 ft of movement, so this is permitted (MOVE_01). Attack: Using the last roll of 14 plus attack bonus +5 gives a total of 19. Captain Voss has AC 15. 19 >= 15, so the attack hits (ATK_01). Damage: 1d8+3 averages to 7 slashing damage. Captain Voss HP was 30, reduced to 23 (DMG_01). Turn ends and advances to the next entity in initiative order (TURN_01).",
